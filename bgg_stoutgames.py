#a script to create a table calculating the "stoutness" of a list of games on boardgamegeek.com

#a "stout" game is one that is short but heavy. The more tough decisions that can be crammed into a brief play time the better.  This script calculates "stoutness" by the weight divided by the min play length. Both of those statistics are highly variable so the results are very arguable, but it's a decent starting point. It is heavily biased toward sub-hour length games, but I like it that way.

#this script takes around 20 minutes to complete so keep your calm
